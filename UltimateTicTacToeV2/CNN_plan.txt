run the program until 10000 games and see any learning.
if avgloss is getting bigger change LR to 0.0001. run 10000
change to DDQN. for 10000 games
CNNN:
    use CNN net: with these layers:
    1. CNN: input 9*9, 1 channel , kernel 3*3, 8 output chanels, stride 3 = 8 * 9 = 72
    2.flattern + last place + action = 76 -> 64 _> 1
